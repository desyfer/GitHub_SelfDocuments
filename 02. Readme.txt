01) # works like a header tag in html. The number of #'s decide the importance (and hence the font size and font-weight) of the heading...the lesser the #, the more important it is. There HAS to be a space between the last # and the first letter of the heading. The whole line is the header. Headers can go from # (1) to ###### (6).

## Hello

is the same as:

<h2>Hello</h2>

02) Anything written inside ` ` is viewed as code. ` is the button right below the escape button...the one with ~ in it.

03) Anything written inside ** ** is viewed as bold, while anything written inside _ _ is viewed in italics and anything written inside ~~ ~~ appears as strike through.

	NOTE: ** ** and __ __ are for bold and _ _ and * * are for italics (yeah confusing, so stick to one)

04) To create a link, type the words that appear inside [] and the url of the link inside () and write it like:
	
	[]()

05) Ordered Lists can be listed like (the numbering will be done automatically and the numbering type changes with each indent {done with TABS}):

1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
	1. Item 3a
	1. Item 3b

NOTE: There has to be a space after the numbering

06) Unordered lists can be listed like:

* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Item 2a
  * Item 2b

NOTE: There has to be a space after the bullets. You can also use - instead of *. The bullet type changes with each indent (done with TABS) too

07) Images can be added like:

![Alt Text](url)

08) You can add quotes with > like:

>

Everything within that line is viewed as a quote.

09) You can add code with just indenting the whole of block of code by 44 spaces.

10) You can use syntax highlighting for various languages by encapsuling the code like:

```languagename
//code
```

eg.
```javascript
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if(arg) {
    $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
  }
}
```
